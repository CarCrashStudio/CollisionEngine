# Contribution Guidlines
LinkEngine is free to modify by anyone in the community.
As such these are some guildines that I feel will keep the project running smoothly for everyone.

- ## 1. Always leave  thoughtful commit comments
   This is a huge one. If we don't know what exactly you did, we can't easily fix it.
   Steer away from leaving simple one word commits when possible
- ## 2. Deter from commiting cide that prevents the project from running
   Not everyone contributing to this project should have to solve your issue, simply so they can continue debugging their own.
- ## 3. Always push to development
   We do not want untested coded being pushed to release and be used by the public.
   Project managers will pull development to release on a scheduled basis so long as the code works.
  
These guidelines are inplace to ensure everyone can enjoy working on the project and that the project can be properly tested and deployed.
Thank you for reading,
